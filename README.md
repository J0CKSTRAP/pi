# Rusty-pi

This is just a fun program for me to learn rust. It's not focused on speed, just on functionality.

These are the times I got with a Ryzen 5 5600 6 core:

500 digits - 239.5 ms

1000 digits - 1.2 s

2000 digits - 6.8 s

3000 digits - 19.8 s

4000 digits - 42.9 s

6969 digits - 203.7 s

10000 digits - 584.68 s

**A LOT OF THIS CODE IS NOT MINE AND I DON'T CLAIM IT TO BE MINE. THIS IS JUST FOR LEARNING PURPOSES.**
